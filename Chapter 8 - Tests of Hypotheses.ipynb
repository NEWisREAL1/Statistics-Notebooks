    "A manufacturer of sprinkler systems used for fire protection in office buildings claims that the true average system-activation temperature is $130^\\circ F$. A sample of $n=9$ systems, when tested, yields a sample average activation temperature of $131.08^\\circ F$. If the distribution of activation times is normal with standard deviation $1.5^\\circ F$, does the data contradict the manufacturer's claim at significance level $0.01$?"

    "So one can find a appropriate critical value $c$ from the binomial sum table for a $\\alpha$ level of significance test. Because $X$ has a discrete probability distribution, it is usually not possible to find a value of $c$ for which $\\alpha$ is exactly the desired significance level (e.g., $.05$ or $.01$). Instead, the value of $c$ that create the largest rejection region satisfying $P(\\text{type I error}) \\le \\alpha$ is used."

    "Or in another way, one can test a hypothesis about a proportion by computing the probability of observing a proportion *at least as extreme as* the observed sample (this probability is called $P$-value) value when assuming that $H_0$ is true, and then reject $H_0$ only if the probability is less than or equal to the specify significance of the test. The following example will illustrate this method. "
